  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>A seismic scale used for measuring the intensity of an earthquake. </li>
<li>It measures the effects of an earthquake. </li>
<li>Note: The intensity of an earthquake is not totally determined by its magnitude. </li>
<li>It is not based on first physical principles, it is based on observed effects.</li>
